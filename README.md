### Hello!👋
I am one of the thousands of **Rob Reids** on the planet. But if you want to be specific, you can call me **Reliable Rascal**, my GitHub name. 

<p>As someone who loves <strong>narrative</strong> and <strong>numbers</strong> and <strong>civic empowerment</strong>, I've recently found a way to roll all three into a coherent new-ish career as a data journalist supporting state and local nonprofit media outlets. 

I'm now a data journalism intern at the **Jacksonville Tributary**. There I've been converting an R script originally created by the 4-AM-coding-mastermind **[apantazi](https://github.com/topics/legislative-dashboard)** into a streamlined **[legislative voting data pipeline](https://github.com/reliablerascal/fl-legislation-etl)** supporting an interactive **[legislator dashboard](https://github.com/reliablerascal/fl-legislation-app-postgres)**. My intent is to make it easier for others to maintain/develop the app, quickly adapt it to different jurisdictions, and create new apps from the same processed data using any programming language.

  Prior to my Tributary internship, I **fact-checked** and documented public meetings for <a href="https://www.documenters.org/">City Bureau</a>, **scraped** election night results, and **<a href="https://reliablerascal.github.io/">wrote freelance articles</a>**. Here you'll find some of my freelance data wrangling work:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Wrangled/transformed/analyzed public and FOIA-acquired data sets</strong> about <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/snow-clearance">snow clearance and fines for unshoveled sidewalks</a>
  <li><strong>Divvy bikeshare data pipelines</strong> to explore <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/divvy-winter/tree/main/notebooks">ridership patterns<a> and <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/divvy-performance">station bike availability</a>
    <li><strong>Map-based scrollytelling stories</strong> about <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/fort-washington">access to Fort Washington Park</a> and <a href="https://github.com/reliablerascal/bike-far-southeast">Chicago's Southeast Side wetland parks</a>
<li>My collaborative contribution to developing the <strong><a href="https://github.com/data-liberation-project/tsa-complaint-counts">TSA complaints data pipeline</a></strong> with the <a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data Liberation Project</a>.
</ul>

👯 I’m looking to collaborate with news outlets on these and similar types of data wrangling and mapping projects.
